# preCICE-adapter for the CFD code OpenFOAM

_**Note:** This adapter is currently in a testing phase. Please report any issues here and give us feedback through the [preCICE mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice)._

_**Note:** Currently the adapter supports conjugate heat transfer simulations. The adapter is easily extensible and support for mechanical fluid-structure interaction is planned._

This adapter was developed as part of Gerasimos Chourdakis' master's thesis [1].
It is based on [previous work](https://github.com/ludcila/CHT-preCICE) by Lucia Cheung ([master's thesis](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) [2], in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/)).
